    <h1>Week 5 Notes:</h1>
    <p>- System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.</p>
    <p>- user errors are in fact also programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way that prevents the user from making the error.</p>
    <p>- An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error.</p>
    <p>- stack trace is a sequence of functions or method calls that lead to the point where the error occurred.</p>
