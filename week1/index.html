    <h1>Week 1 Notes:</h1>
    <p>- Is CSS the only way to resize the header if I would like to create a header bigger than h1 or smallest than h4?</p>
    <p>- In the following part of code: document.getElementById(“story_display”).innerHTML = storyHTML. Does the part ".innerHTML" show that the storyHTML will be displayed as HTML? </p>
