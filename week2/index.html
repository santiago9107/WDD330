    <h1>Week 2 Questions:</h1>
    <p>- How can I interpret the second column called "due" in the reading schedule table? For instance, what does it mean 2.Wednesday?</p>
    <p>- In what way should the main.js interact with the HTML index for the portfolio assignment?</p>
    <p>- Is CSS the only way to resize the header if I would like to create a header bigger than h1 or smallest than h4?</p>
    <p>- Where is the data saved when we use localStorage?</p>
    <p>- How long does the data saved when we use localStorage remains?</p>
    <p>- Are the challenges free topic activities?</p>
    <h1>Week 2 Notes:</h1>
    <p>- undefined, NaN, Infinity are not reserved words but should have been.</p>
    <p>- Primitive data types: string, symbol, number, boolean, undefined, null.</p>
    <p>- Any value that is not a primitive data is an object.</p>
    <p>- It is possible to find the type of a value using the operator typeof.</p>
    <p>- JavaScript uses the keywords const and let to declare variables.</p>
    <p>- const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value.</p>
    <p>- let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</p>
