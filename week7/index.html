    <h1>Week 7 Notes:</h1>
    <p>- Functions are first-class objects which means they can have properties and methods themselves.</p>
    <p>- The call() method can be used to set the value of this inside a function.</p>
    <p>- If the function that’s called requires any parameters, these need to be provided as arguments after the first argument, which is always the value of this.</p>
    <p>- Memoization: we can save the result in a cache property. Then if the same argument is used again later, we can return the value from the cache, rather than having to compute the result again.</p>
