    <p>- select menus: for drop-down lists of options</p>
    <p>- The placeholder attribute will insert the value provided in the input field until
the user enters some text.</p>
    <p>- simply button creates a clickable button that can have an event listener attached to it</p>
    <p>- menuitem and li tags to create a dropdown menu when it’s clicked on</p>
    <p>- JavaScript validation should be used to enhance the user experience when filling in a form by giving feedback about any errors before it’s submitted.</p>
    <p>- A submit button can be disable by added the disabled attribute to the input element</p>
